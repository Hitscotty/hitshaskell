  Hi it's Scotty, get it? HitScotty! Well my real name is Jonathan, but everyone calls me Scotty.

I'm 22 years old, recent college graduate, in pursuit of a career in software development. On my free time I like programming in Haskell
and reading really cool interesting research papers on things I have no clue about! The more difficult, the more alluring and interesting. I love learning new things as much as I love thinking in Haskell.

Current Topics of Interests:

* Functional Paradigms
* Denotational Symantics of Programming

## Haskell ::Me

I discovered Haskell while watching my favorite youtube channel [computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqV3pL5x8PI). With only just a simple explanation of how a list of numbers
from 1 to 10 can be added together in a Functional Programming language, I was absolutely captivated and sold. I needed to discover the language that was Haskell with features like "pattern matching" and ```sum [1..10]```. It has only been a few months since then and through Haskell I have learned so much beyond the scope of Haskell from lambda calculus to a thing or two on compilers.
