title: What is this Blog?
---
 I'm casually reading through this [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com) and these are my solutions. I really love programming in Haskell and all the theory that comes with it. In order to become a master of the craft I'm going to keep maintain a blog so that I can review concepts and build on them further. In a nutshell this blog is my way of choosing to be better, choosing the path of growth and learning.  <3
